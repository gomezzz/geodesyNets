    "# Key Findings for Eros and Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Next-Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings of the `total_experiment_*` runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "General nomenclature in-precision:\n",
    "* low-range/ low-height = several 100 m above surface\n",
    "* mid-range/ mid-height = few km above surface\n",
    "* high-range/ high-height = safe(r) distance for satellites (like e.g. Rosetta 30 km periphrasis)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Eros and CG?\n",
    "\n",
    "* CG: Less mass, weird shape, SRP lower*\n",
    "* Eros: More mass, less-weird-shape, SRP higher*, (I like potatoes)\n",
    "\n",
    "*based on semi-major axis (I know CG has high eccentricity)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact of Sampling Distance & Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Academic Range $[0, 1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Without Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Academic Range of $[0, 1]$ for sampling, which corresponds to\n",
    "    * Eros: $[0 km, 20km]$\n",
    "    * CG: $[0 km, 3 km]$\n",
    "* Even close to the surface robust prediction of the acceleration\n",
    "* relRMSE below 5% until 200m above surface level\n",
    "* Macon & Polyhedral Model generally not that different (TODO: significance test?)\n",
    "    * Eros and CG Mascon Model are generated from the same mesh ground truth --> **Hypothesis:** dependency bias?\n",
    "    * Mascon model \"not that\" different with similar resolution (discretization) based on the surface geometry\n",
    "    * Numerical Error of Integration --> TODO: Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### With Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "* Degraded performance. However, it depends on the employed type of noise\n",
    "* Gaussian Noise (weak) representing instrumental in-precision\n",
    "    * Still decent performance even until low height\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis:** With Ferrari of Accelerometer --> Onboard-training no problemo\n",
    "* Gaussian Noise (strong) representing 10x more in-precision\n",
    "    * For CG: Performance good until mid-height\n",
    "    * For Eros: Performance good until low-height\n",
    "    * Currently, we use instrumental in-precision independent of the gravitational magnitude. Eros is more massive. Thus, the same Gaussian Noise's magnitude is comparably smaller to the real ground truth.\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis:** Application of worse instruments more suitable for more massive bodies\n",
    "    * Incorporate: Error in Sample Distance Range\n",
    "* Constant Bias Noise (representing Solar Radiation Pressure):\n",
    "    * Practically for \"real\" spacecraft always pretty low\n",
    "        * CubeSat: Low due to small area\n",
    "        * Proper Rosetta-Like Satellite: Low due to huge mass\n",
    "        * **That's the main reason why this time, SRP is actually not that big influence at all compared to the previous results with a abnormal high constant bias**\n",
    "    * This experiment was conducted with the Rosetta-style values, but the CubeSat's values are in a similiar magnitude\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis:** Good performance until low-height, Impact neglectable, at least for the given bodies?\n",
    "    * Eros: Interesting degradation, but to be observed if this is just one training-run\n",
    "* Combined Gaussian Noise + Constant Bias\n",
    "    * Interesting small peak for mid-height --> Also given for normal Gaussian (only for CG)\n",
    "        * **Hypothesis** Gaussian Noise magnitude in the same order of magnitude as the gravity?\n",
    "        * Otherwise, the network is might be capable to learn that the \"overshoot\"/ \"undershoot\" are artificial\n",
    "    * Otherwise, the Gaussian Noise seems to be the dominant effect (which it is) disturbing the results\n",
    "    * Eros: Weird peek for Mascon model! Do we have some instability here...? Or is this just one run? More data required!\n",

    "    * CG: $[3 km, 9 km]$\n",
    "* relRMSE below 5% until mid-height around 3 km for CG, but much higher for Eros 20 km\n",
    "    * **Hypothesis** Not surprising, since our Eros sampling starts from 20km\n",

    "\n",
    "* Run with \"dynamic\" Gaussian Noise wich adapts to the actual magnitude simulating \"We know the order of magnitude and can safely say the first digits of the acceleration\" --> Simple to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Re-validate with noise in ground-truth? Implemented as suggested last time, but not yet run due to realistic constant bias results --> Already implemented\n",
    "* Pre-training: Basically, combine Academic $[0, 1]$ without noise (top-left corner) on `low_res` with the absolute worst (bottom-right-corner) after-training --> Already implemented\n",
    "    * Fundamentals implemented but scale of the experiment\n",
    "    * 1x pre-trained model with 10 seeds \"after-burner\"?\n",
    "    * 10x pre-trained model with each 10 seeds \"after-burner\"?\n",
    "    * Alternative scenario. Pre-Train with far-away sampling and improve with close-approach with SRP pebbles\n",
    "* Formulate paper based on above results\n",
    "* Conference Orga Questions?\n",
    "    * I guess, it's the student package, right?\n",
    "    * Hotel booking?\n",
    "* IDP Orga Question?\n",
    "    * Is this already reported to the bureaucrats? (changed lecture manually to be replaced?)\n",
