## Notebooks

In order to execute the notebooks this folder, relocate them to the root of the
repository and execute them from there.
As an alternative, you can also add the root of the repository to the python path.

## Results

This folder contains all the results obtained with the code in this repository. The two main files are:

- `total_results_eros.csv`: results obtained using (433) Eros
- `total_results_churyumov-gerasimenko.csv`: results obtained using 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko

These contain everything! They are basically concatenations of all `csv` files obtained over the course of the study.

The other `csv` files respectivley contain the `mean` values for specific grouping configurations.

## Archive

This folder contains old notebooks which were used initially to develop the code base.
They are kept here for reference.
However, they are not maintained and may not work with the current code base.
